# brewpi-brewometer

Brewpi and other files modified to support the Tilt Hydrometer.

## Upgrading

__NOTE: Upgrade steps from previous Brewometer install. Skip to Setup & Testing if you are doing a new install__

The references to Brewometer have been changed to Tilt. As such, you will need to do the following:

1. Rename `/home/brewpi/brewometer` directory to `/home/brewpi/tiltHydrometer`
2. Ensure the existing Brewometer.py file has been deleted (note: the code will still work if this file remains - this is just a cleanup step).

If this is not your first install of the Tilt Hydrometer modification, you will need to add the `python-scipy` and `python-numpy` libraries via apt-get. These libraries are used in the calibration function.
```
sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-numpy
```

## Setup & Testing

1. Ensure you are updated to the latest version of Brewpi using the update script in the `brewpi-tools` folder.
2. On the Raspberry Pi you need to install the bluez and python-bluez bluetooth modules to enable communication with the Tilt Hydrometer.
```
sudo apt-get install bluez python-bluez python-scipy python-numpy libcap2-bin
```

3. Enable python to query bluetooth without being root.
```
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which python`)
```

4. Test that you've now enabled a connection by running the utility in the tiltHydrometer-test folder (this should not be run as root to test that we've enabled the appropriate permissions)
```
python TiltHydrometerTest.py
```

If you see values against your colour Tilt Hydrometer, then the connection is successful. :tada:

## Modifying Brewpi for Tilt Hydrometer logging

1. Ensure you have stopped any active logging.
2. The files in the `brewpi-web` folder should be copied to the `/var/www` directory. Ensure you fix the ownership once the files are copied over (`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www`)
3. The files in the `brewpi-script` folder should be copied to the `/home/brewpi` directory. Ensure you fix the ownership once the files are copied over (`sudo chown -R brewpi:brewpi /home/brewpi`)
4. Once the files have been copied across, you'll need to refresh the web interface and restart the script (button in top right-hand corner) to start logging. 

## Calibration:

To enable calibration for a Tilt Hydrometer create `GRAVITY.<colour>` or `TEMPERATURE.<colour>` files in the `/home/brewpi/tiltHydrometer` folder. Example files have been provided to show the syntax. For example, to calibrate a Red Tilt Hydrometer's temperature, a `TEMPERATURE.red` file should be created with the calibration settings inside.
